- 👋 Hi, I’m @Star34215
- 👀 I have 5+ years audit-related experience and have contributed 3+ years in finding potential risks as an Operational Audit. 
     During my career, 3 years in Taishin-Security as underwriter, I am used to co-work with others not only my co-workers but different functional people include accounting, marketing, production, procurement.
     These are precious lessons which give me the ability to inspect the deficiency of team in different perspective, and then resolve the problem in a cost-effective way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the field of web crawling, data cleaning, data analyzing with Python, since I know these tools can lead me to preoces data to get features of data and know the trend of fields.  
- 💞️ I am looking for junior position at data-analyst and data-engineer area.
